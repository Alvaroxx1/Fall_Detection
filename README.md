# Fall Detection

The models perform better and the training process is faster using the pretrained model yolov8n.pt for pose stimation.
You can try using yolov8s.pt, yolov8m.pt, etc.

### Future Work

* Improve Dataset
    * Different Illumination and environment   
* Provide a complex model to train 
* Improve performance of the model (precision & recall)
* Implemnet a notification system
